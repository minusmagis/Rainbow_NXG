For 3mm pinhole (PLA White)

7.083 mW      ->       1002.04 W/m^2


Without pinhole (measured by MCV on 2021/06/02) 
79 mW   ->     1006 W/m^2 (considering a circular surface with radius 5mm)



With the resine printed pinehole for light pipe

68 mW  ->   1551 W/m^2 (considering the light pipe cross-section, which is not really the same size...)

One sun of the light pipe correponds to 55 mW
