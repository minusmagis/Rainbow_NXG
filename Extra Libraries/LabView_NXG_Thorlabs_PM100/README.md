# LabView NXG Thorlabs PM100
 This is the unofficial LabView NXG library to control the PM100 photodetector series from Thorlabs, adapted and developed from LabView 2015 version by Mart√≠ Gibert Roca.

To use it, one just needs to copy the folder into their project and add the .gcomp file to their LabView project within Labview NXG as a new file, that will add all the subVIs. From there one can use the examples to see how it works. NIVISA drivers are required for it to work.

Cheers :)
